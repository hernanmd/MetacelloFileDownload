# MetacelloFileDownload

Add helper methods to download resources in Baseline or Metacello Configurations in Pharo Smalltalk. The files that you specify will be downloaded and uncompressed without need to write any code.

# Installation

```smalltalk
Metacello new
	baseline: 'MetacelloFileDownload';
	repository: 'github://hernanmd/MetacelloFileDownload';
	load.
```

# Rules of the game

- You can upload your files anywhere you want.
- All your files must be already uploaded in .zip or .tar.gz
- If you use Windows, .zip files will be downloaded and uncompressed in the #workingDirectory.
- If you use Unix/MacOS, .tar.gz files will be downloaded and uncompressed in the #workingDirectory.
- You can add several (mirror) URL's for the same resource file (see Example below).

# Usage

- Add the following line in the #baseline method of your Configuration/Baseline:

```smalltalk
"... configuration code ... "
spec preLoadDoIt: #preLoad.
"... configuration code ... "
```

To enable bootstrapping add the following two methods to your Configuration/Baseline (instance side)

```smalltalk
ensureMetacelloFileDownload     
  Metacello new           
    baseline: 'MetacelloFileDownload';              
    repository: 'github://hernanmd/MetacelloFileDownload';          
    load.
```

Add the #preLoad method:

```smalltalk
preLoad
    self ensureMetacelloFileDownload.
    super preLoad.
```

- In your Configuration class (instance side), add a method with selector #platformFilesUrl answering a Collection of download URL's. Examples:
  - If you have mirror URL's for your resource file:
```smalltalk
^ Smalltalk os isWin32 		
    ifTrue: [ #(
        'https://github.com/....file1.zip'
	'http://www.dropbox.com/file1.zip' ) ]
     ifFalse: [ #(
	'https://github.com/....file1.tar.gz'
	'http://www.dropbox.com/file1.tar.gz') ].
```
    - If you have one URL for your resource file: (don't forget the last / before the last URL fragment)
```smalltalk
^ Array with: (String streamContents: [ : stream |		
    stream 			
       nextPutAll: 'https://github.com/yourGHUser/yourProject/raw/master/res/';
       nextPutAll: (
           Smalltalk os isWin32 					
	       ifTrue: [ 'file1.zip' ]
	       ifFalse: [ 'file1.tar.gz' ]) ])
```
- That's all. Try your Configuration or Baseline script!
